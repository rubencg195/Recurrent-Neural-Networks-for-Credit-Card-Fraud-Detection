JAN 8 - Background research

1. Read the following papers:
  1. Transaction Fraud DetectionUsingGRU-centered Sandwich-structured Model
    Notes:
      ML models previously used: "Supervised  models  like logistic regression (LR),support vector machine (SVM) and random forest(RF)are  estimated  by  labeled  historical  transaction data. Unsupervised methods like isolation forest (IF) usually identify outliers as potential  fraudulent  cases. Nevertheless, most of these methods treat each transaction as an   independent   individual   and   ignore   the   associations between them."
