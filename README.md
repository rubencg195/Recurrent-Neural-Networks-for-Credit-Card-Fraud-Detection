**JAN 7 - Introductions and setup**

1. Meeting with the Verafin team.
2. Learn about how Verafin works.
3. Tour through the building. 
4. Setup fingerprints.

**JAN 8 - Background research**

1. Read the following papers:
  -  Transaction Fraud DetectionUsingGRU-centered Sandwich-structured Model

      **Notes:**
      ML models previously used: "Supervised  models  like logistic regression (LR),support vector machine (SVM) and random forest(RF)are  estimated  by  labeled  historical  transaction data. Unsupervised methods like isolation forest (IF) usually identify outliers as potential  fraudulent  cases. Nevertheless, most of these methods treat each transaction as an   independent   individual   and   ignore   the   associations between them." 

2. Check the following datasets:
  - https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
  - Anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or genuine (https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/banksim1)
  - Synthetic datasets generated by the BankSim payments simulator (https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1) 
  - Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection PaySim (https://www.kaggle.com/isaikumar/creditcardfraud)
3. Create the project's repository. (  https://github.com/rubencg195/mitacs-internship  )
4. Fingerprints and wifi are now working.
