# DESCRIPTION

Fraudulent activity is hard to detect due to the low amounts of incidents among themillions  of credit  card transactions,  but  it can  cost millions  of dollars  in  monetarylosses and legal costs to financial institutions.  The lack of open-source fraud labeleddata and the unbalanced nature of such, make it hard for engineers and computer/datascientists  to  design  solutions  to  detect  financial  fraud.   Recurrent  Neural  Networks(RNNs) are a promising machine learning approach for fraud detection due to theirability to learn patterns from time series.  In this study, the use of RNNs for frauddetection  was  explored.   To  do  this,  first  we  gathered  the  BankSim  synthetic  andpublicly available credit card transaction dataset.  Next, RNNs variations were designand tried.  Finally, a performance assessment of RNNs for fraud was made.

# GOAL

During the research, BankSim and PaySim's data was used to train different RNN variations to find the best performing model.
